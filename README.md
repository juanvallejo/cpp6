CS427 Project 6

To clone, simply `cd` to the downloaded skeleton on your local environment, then type:

```
git init
git remote add origin <URL_OF_REPO>
git fetch origin master
git checkout FETCH_HEAD -- *
git checkout FETCH_HEAD
git checkout -b master
```

Once this has been done, a `git pull` should suffice, no need to clone this whole thing and track every project file.
